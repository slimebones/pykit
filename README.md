# Antievil

Collection of Errors/Exceptions for different programming languages.

Due to different naming conventions in programming languages, the error objects
are suffixed with `Exception` or `Error`. For simplicity, the general
specification uses `Error` as a main suffix.

General Specification arguments' types are written in Python style, different
languages will have different *respective* types. For example for Python's
`Any` there might be C#'s `object` and TS's `any`.
